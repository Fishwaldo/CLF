Centralised logserver scripts

About
=====
These scripts tie logwatch together with PostgreSQL to generate summary
information that will be stored in the database from syslog data stored in
the database.

Running the script
==================
To run the script type /etc/log.d/bin/parselog.sh systemname datespec
systemname: the name of the system to parse logdata from, ex: clf
datespec: the datespec is a dateformat that PostgreSQL understands, or you
can use the keywords today, yesterday or all. If omitted, all is used.

How the script works
====================
The script will take the syslog data from the database (for the specified
host and for the specified datespec) and put it in
/var/tmp/var/log. The logwatch script is then run and the output is then
stored in the database in the syslog_tsummary table. The output in
/var/tmp/var/log is then deleted.

Adding a new host type
======================
The only specified host type, as of this writing, is linux. To add, say
solaris, add a row in the syslog_tpremadetype for "Solaris Host" with the
logwatch_cmd set to solaris. Then copy the contents from
/etc/log.d/configs/linux to /etc/log.d/configs/solaris and edit the contents
of the directories below /etc/log.d/configs/solaris to match what you want
to look for in the solaris logfiles.
